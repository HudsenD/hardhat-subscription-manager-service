DO NOT use this contract for production of any sort.
Although this contract has many flaws, it does accomplish the original goal I had when I made this.
This is a practice contract that I made with one goal: Make an automatic subscription service
I knew it was not going to be optimal, 

Last thing to do: Make readme explaining everything, how the original plan was to implement chainlink keepers, but for now I have decided to move on and make a new project. maybe add some other minor things, 
update gitIgnore then push to github
